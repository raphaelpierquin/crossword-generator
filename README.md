# Crossword generator
Generates crosswords and exports them to HTML, png or ascii.

# Thanks 
- to Bryan Helmig for his inspiration for this script. He did a lot of work which 
I could improve in some ways.
See http://bryanhelmig.com/python-crossword-puzzle-generator/ for his code.
- to Daniel NÃ¶gel for his work.
- to Tojo Rakotoarison for his contributions.

# Still TODO !
- The "solution" feature is not totally implemented for the CSV output.
- Add a way to rework on existing output crosswords.

# Font 
To get the output font working on Ubuntu: 

1. use apt-get to install package `ttf-mscorefonts-installer`
2. edit `crossword.py` to have the correct path to `arial.ttf`
